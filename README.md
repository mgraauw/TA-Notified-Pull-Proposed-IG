A proposal for a FHIR IG for the TA Notified Pull.

IMPORTANT: This is NOT the formally published TA Notified Pull.

See: https://www.twiin.nl/tanp for the official version, as well as background to understand this IG.

In this repo:
- resources-original: the original examples from the above spec. Contains errors.txt with validator error messages.
- resources-r3: fixed examples for FHIR R3. Contains errors.txt with validator error messages.
- a FHIR R4 Implementation Guide used as a basis for fixing the R3 examples (R4 was used since t-it's better supported, changes were backported to resources-r3 folder)
- See: [FHIR IG](output/index.html) and [QA page]"(output/qa.html)
